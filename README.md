Yuxin Wu yuxin.wu@emory.edu

In this homework, I explored different scenario of Pandemic Spread Modeling. Different parameters can affect the infection in different ways.


In the future, we can add more real-world scenario in the experiment, like adding frequently visited areas (e.b. school, store), and restriced areas for patients.
